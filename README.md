## ðŸŽ¬ Project Story

In a dazzling neon galaxy inspired by 80s arcade visuals, two retro hover cars race through a glowing cityscape and across a futuristic space tunnel. The cars zoom past neon-lit structures, leaving light trails in their wake, until one of them enters a wormhole and disappears. The scene is backed by synthwave music and cinematic camera angles for an immersive retro vibe.
